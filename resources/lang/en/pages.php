From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible bears witness to human mobility as an essential part of God’s people’s experience. Throughout history, the Church has walked alongside communities on the move, facing challenges and embracing new opportunities. This is reflected in the life of the Church, where migration has been a constant. Preachers are called to proclaim hope, just as Jesus did amid the trauma caused by human displacement.',

How can our preaching honor identity in the lived experiences of migrants? How do we address trauma with pastoral sensitivity and theological depth? Join us as we equip, inspire, and challenge one another to be a voice of justice and grace in a world and a Church on the move.',
