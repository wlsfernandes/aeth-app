If the tags are in Spanish, the document is in Spanish. The only exception is that Bible references will always appear in both languages (e.g., Lucas 12 / Luke 12). You can then proceed as described above by clicking on a document’s title.',

Currently, most of our collections include weekly Bible lessons—the teacher version—covering three months and published either in <i>Lecciones Cristianas</i> or in <i>El Discípulo</i>.
