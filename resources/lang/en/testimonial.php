        'p1' => 'Blessings, greetings from Professor Elimelec Cordero of the Hispanic Biblical Seminary located in the windy city, here in Chicago, Illinois. Today I want to talk to you about the importance and impact that the AETH certification has had on our Bible Institute. I consider the acquisition of this certification status by AETH through the ATS to be among the most important phases that the Hispanic Bible Seminary has had in its last 51 years of history. The most marked aspects that I believe have benefited from this certification is the recognition of its academic rigor, on the other hand open doors to dialogue with accredited institutions and finally also the academic resources that did not exist before the certification. I believe that AETH`s certification has allowed us to guarantee its students that academic rigor and certify the school`s commitment to academic excellence. And the certification has also opened doors for the Hispanic Biblical Seminary to achieve academic alliances with other seminaries and universities so that our students can advance in their theological and professional training by graduating with master`s and baccalaureate degrees. I encourage you to consider initiating this certification process with AETH, I believe that like the Hispanic Biblical Seminary it will be a means to guarantee academic excellence, open doors with other theological training institutions and acquire academic resources that are vital for biblical institutes.',

        'p1' => 'Hi, I`m Esteban Austin, the director of the International Bible Institute of Texas, based in Houston, TX. One of our professors, Omar Palafox, told us about AETH, and encouraged us to apply for institutional membership in AETH. These are four important reasons for seeking and maintaining our membership in AETH: 1. To expand our network of contacts with people, churches, and institutions in the United States and Puerto Rico. 2. To learn from them and their experiences in how they train brothers and sisters to serve in the Kingdom and the church. To take advantage of the resources, whether digital or written, that AETH offers. that we did not have before. In particular, we are excited about the addition of resources from Pitt`s digital library at Emory University. To obtain the certification offered by AETH and ATS of our bachelor`s degree in ministry and biblical studies, thus gaining important external validation of our program and professors. These blessings, especially the certification, have helped us grow in program quality and in the number of people interested in studying with us. In fact, the first year after receiving certification, scholarship applications grew by 40%! I highly recommend AETH for these reasons! God bless you!',

This was a transformative space that highlighted the calling, ministry, and impact of women in pastoral ministry. This workshop not only offered clear and deep definitions of what a calling means, the distinction between proclamation and preaching, and the essence of ministry (among others), but also emphasized the importance of making visible the role of women in the Scriptures. It was mentioned that more than 122 women spoke (proclaimed and preached) in the Bible. It was an enriching experience that not only provided knowledge, but also affirmed and strengthened my own pastoral calling as a woman, inspiring me to continue working for the glory of God. Thank you for this valuable contribution to the strengthening of female leadership in the church! May God greatly bless you and may you continue sowing in the Kingdom of God."',

        'p1' => '“Regarding the experience, I would rate it a 20 out of 10. It was incredible! The theme was very timely and extremely necessary for our current reality. The most remarkable aspect of everything that was shared—and what I absolutely loved—was that it wasn’t a space to belittle men. On the contrary, every word shared was aimed at highlighting that just as the ministry of men is important for the Kingdom of God, so is the ministry of women.With this in mind, it is essential that, as the Church and body of Christ, we begin to open spaces for dialogue where we are invited to deconstruct certain mindsets that, in one way or another, distort what the ministry of women should be—and, as a result, affect the very essence of the Gospel. With much love and discernment, we must begin to teach that God does not choose to grant ministries based on our gender. He chooses us and gives us ministries based on what is in our hearts.”',
